# sparseRepresentationCourseProject


**This is a course project for sparse respresentation with Prof. John Wright. We base our algorithms on the paper: Robust face recognition via sparse representation[J]. We reconstruct the paper in Python.**

A different normalization method is done from the codes from the original paper.

`This is a project by Qingwei Wu and Xiangfeng Gong.`
