# sparseRepresentationCourseProject


**This is a course project for sparse respresentation with Prof. John Wright. We base our algorithms on the paper: Robust face recognition via sparse representation[J]. We reconstruct the paper in Python and have reached a very good accuracy in face recognition.**

`This is a project by Qingwei Wu and Xiangfeng Gong.
